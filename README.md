# 📰 Fake News Headline Generator
A simple and fun Python project that creates random, funny news headlines just for laughs! 😄
Perfect for beginners who are learning Python basics like lists, random, input(), and loops.

## 🎯 Project Objective
This project was created for fun and as a way to practice Python fundamentals. It’s a great mini-project for beginners who want to build something simple but interactive!

## 🧠 Concepts Used

| Concept           | What It Does                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `lists`           | To store groups of subjects, actions, and places |
| `random.choice()` | To randomly pick one item from a list            |
| `print()`         | To display the generated headline                |
| `input()`         | To ask the user if they want another headline    |
| `while` loop      | To repeat until the user says "no"               |
| `f-strings`       | To combine words into a complete sentence        |

## 💡 Pseudocode (Logic Behind the Project)

Step 1: Import the `random` module

Step 2: Create lists of subjects, actions, and places — all with Indian examples

Step 3: Use `random.choice()` to pick one word from each list

Step 4: Combine the words into a headline using string formatting

Step 5: Print the headline to the user

Step 6: Ask the user if they want another headline

Step 7: If yes, repeat; if no, stop the program

## 💡 How It Works

-- The program:

◻ Randomly selects a subject, an action, and a place/event

◻ Combines them into a fake breaking news headline

◻ Asks if you'd like another one

-- Example output: 

BREAKING NEWS: Harry Potter celebrates at Red Fort

Do you want another headline? (yes/no)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

◻ Python 3

◻ Built-in random module

◻ VS Code (for coding and running)

## 🧠 What I Learned

◻ Working with Python lists

◻ Using the random module to generate unpredictable output

◻ Writing interactive CLI programs using input()

◻ Structuring beginner-level code clearly

## 📌 Project Level: Beginner

This project is ideal for those who are:

◻ Just starting with Python

◻ Looking for a fun practice project

◻ Interested in building basic logic and interactivity
