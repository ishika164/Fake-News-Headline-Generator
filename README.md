# 📰 Fake News Headline Generator
A simple and fun Python project that creates random, funny news headlines just for laughs! 😄
Perfect for beginners who are learning Python basics like lists, random, input(), and loops.

## 🎯 Project Objective
Create a fun and interactive Python program that generates random, humorous fake news headlines by combining random subjects, actions, and places using basic Python concepts like lists, loops, string formatting, and user input.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

| Concept           | What It Does                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `lists`           | To store groups of subjects, actions, and places |
| `random.choice()` | To randomly pick one item from a list            |
| `print()`         | To display the generated headline                |
| `input()`         | To ask the user if they want another headline    |
| `while` loop      | To repeat until the user says "no"               |
| `f-strings`       | To combine words into a complete sentence        |

## 💻 Pseudocode

1. START the program

2. IMPORT the random module

3. CREATE a list of Indian subjects

   Example:
   ["Shahrukh Khan", "Virat Kohli", "Nirmala Sitharaman", "A Mumbai Cat", "A Group of Monkeys"]

4. CREATE a list of Indian actions
   
   Example:
   ["launches", "cancels", "dances with", "eats", "declares war on"]

5. CREATE a list of Indian places or things

   Example:
   ["at Red Fort", "in Mumbai local train", "a plate of samosas", "inside Parliament", "at Ganga ghat"]

6. START a loop (while loop) that keeps running until the user says "no"

   a. RANDOMLY choose one item from each list (subject, action, place)
   
   b. COMBINE the three chosen words into one sentence using string formatting

      ◾ Format: "BREAKING: {subject} {action} {place}!"
   
   c. PRINT the final fake news headline
   
   d. ASK the user if they want to generate another headline (yes/no)
   
   e. If user says "no", END the loop

7. PRINT a goodbye message

8. END the program
